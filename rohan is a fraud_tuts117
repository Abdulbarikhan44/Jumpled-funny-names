#Easy problem8-rohan is a fraud

'''
Problem Statement
Rohan das is a fraud by nature. Rohan Das wrote a python function
to print a multiplication table of a given number and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.
Rohan Das did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test. You cannot tolerate this!
So you decided to use your python skills to counter Rohan’s actions by writing a python program
that validates Rohan’s multiplication table.
Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in Rohan’s table and expose Rohan Das as a fraud.

Note: Rohan’s function returns a list of numbers like this

Rohan Das’s Function Input:
rohanMultiplication(6)

Rohan’s function returns this output:
[6, 12, 18, 26, …., 60]

You have to write a function isCorrect(table, number) and
return the index where rohan’s function is wrong and print it to the screen!
If the table is correct, your function returns None

import random

def rohanMultiplication(num):
    list1 = []
    wrong_no=random.randint(2,9)           #random number get which use to produce one wrong result
    for i in range (1,11):
        if i==wrong_no:
            list1.append((num)*random.randint(3,9))
            continue
        list1.append(num*i)
    return list1

user_input=int(input("Enter number\n"))
lista=rohanMultiplication(user_input)
print(lista)

def isCorrect(num):
    list2 = []
    for i in range (1,11):
        list2.append(num*i)
    return list2
listb=isCorrect(user_input)
#print(listb)

for i in range(10):
    if lista[i] != listb[i]:
        print(f"Rohan's table wrong\n"
              f"value of {user_input}*{i + 1}={user_input * (i + 1)}")
        break
else:
    print("Rohan's table is Correct")
#if for loop completly end by itself(without break) ,else will access.
