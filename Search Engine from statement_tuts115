"""
You are given few sentences as a list (Python list of sentences).
Take a query string as an input from the user.
You have to pull out the sentences matching this query inputted by the user
in decreasing order of relevance after converting every word in the query and the sentence to lowercase.
The most relevant sentence is the one with the maximum number of matching words with the query.

Sentences = [“Python is cool”, “python is good”, “python is not python snake”]
